# Dimmed orange theme
A cosy theme with low contrast, made to be easier on the eyes than other dark themes and to work well for editing GDScript late at night.

> Note: This is my personal theme, and is hacked together from other people's work. It probably won't work as well for your needs as it does for mine!

Syntax highlighting colours mostly from the ["Warm Night Theme"](https://github.com/slanden/warm-night-theme/blob/main/themes/warm-night.json) by slanden.

Initially based on the "simple orange theme" from https://themes.vscode.one/ with some terminal colours taken from the "Gruvbox Dark Medium" by jdinhlife.
